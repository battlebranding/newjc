                <p>Sundays are certainly worth looking forward to, especially in Spark World! In Spark World your child will be challenged with life changing Biblical truths in fun and engaging ways such as music, conversations, arts and crafts and more in a safe environment. Spiritually, it is very important to reach and teach children where they are and Sundays are a perfect opportunity for that. Outside of Sundays, we believe that every day is important in a child’s life and the role of each parent/guardian is valued and vital to each child’s success.</p>

        <p>We are so honored that you are interested in being a member of New Jerusalem Cathedral.We understand that selecting membership in a church is a major commitment and a vital part of spiritual development. We strongly believe that it is beneficial for men and women to fellowship together in unity, as Psalms 133:1 reminds us. Our Bishop, Dr. Kevin Williams has provided the 3 Core Membership Values:</p>
        <h2 class="has-text-align-center">3 Core Membership Values</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A holistic and biblical theology.</strong> As a member you must come to church and hear the word of God as well as self study to build your spirit and your relationship with God.</li>
            <li><strong>Application theology relationship.</strong> Even as faith comes by hearing the word of God. If it is not applied and lived you will fail in your christian walk and relationship with God. Genesis 1 teaches word must be met with action to prove true understanding.</li>
            <li><strong>An evangelism theology relationship.</strong> Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel is Christâ€™s command and demand. A christian that does not share Christ exhibits no true relationship with Him. Acts 1 shows that we have been given power to evangelize Christ to three areas:
                <ul>
                    <li>Self</li>
                    <li>Family</li>
                    <li>Country</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

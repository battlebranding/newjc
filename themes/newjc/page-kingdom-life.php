        <p>Sundays are a great time to not only come together for our 7am,11am or 6pm worship service but certainly a time of growth and fellowship that you simply donâ€™t get other days of the week. In addition to the worship experience and Word of God we offer Kingdom Life Groups. We believe that outside of Sunday services, life happens in ways that are sometimes easier addressed in smaller group sessions. Kingdom Life groups cover practical life experiences using Biblical solutions. Each group is unique and has the tendency to change based on interest and instructors, so, great news is that there is always something that you can benefit from!</p>

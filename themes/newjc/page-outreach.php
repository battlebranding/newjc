            <h2>Greensboro Tornado Relief</h2>
            <p>On Sunday, April 15, 2018 an EF-2 Tornado with winds reaching 135mph and a width of at least 300 yards touched down in Greensboro. Sitting back and doing nothing wasn't an option. As Christ followers, we are committed to making sure that whenever we're in a position to help, we give compassionately and liberally. It's not enough for us to preach that Jesus saves, we as his students, we must live the Word.</p>

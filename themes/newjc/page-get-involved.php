                    <h3>Every Sunday Morning 9:30 am - 10:30 am</h3>
                    <p>Sunday mornings are a great time to not only come together for worship but certainly a time of growth and fellowship that you simply don’t get other days of the week. We believe that outside of Sunday mornings, life happens in ways that are sometimes easier dealt with in smaller group sessions. Kingdom Life offers groups to cover practical life experiences using biblical solutions. These groups are much smaller than the Sunday morning worship service and meet 8 weeks for one hour weekly.</p>
